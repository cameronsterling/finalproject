    <h2>Part One: Agricultural Degredataion</h2>
    <p>
    In 2018, Turkey and allied forces occupied Afrin, leading to widespread reports of property seizures and agricultural destruction. Given these dynamics, my project asks: How has Afrinâ€™s landscape, especially its olive  orchards, changed since the occupation? And where can we detect signs of degradation? my project has two objectives:
(1) Map land cover in Afrin in 2016, before major occupation events, with a particular focus on locating orchards.
(2) Assess orchard degradation through 2024 by tracking vegetation health and mapping clusters of decline.

    </p>
    <p>
      First, I carried out a RF-based classification based on Sentinel-2 data. I used NDVI, texture, and several color bands. 
    </p>

       <p>
      Then, at the areas that I classified in Syria and Turkey, I looked at key indicators of vegetation health over time, concluding that there was a high level of stress on Syrian orchards.

       <p>
     After that, I created an algorithm that clustered degredation, localizing areas that might have seen deforestation/ environmental stress.

    <h2>Part Two: The Relationship Between Fire and Conflict </h2>
    <p>
In a separate, but related project, I was interested in learning more about fires in Northern Syria. 
      I tried to answer the question: can machine learning distinguish between routine and conflict-associated vegetation fires in Northern Syria? 
    </p>
    <p>
      I then mapped out the coefficients by census tract, aiming to understand where this relationship is the strongest.
