    <h1>Turkish Military Activity in Northern Iraq and Syria</h1>
    <p>
      During my time at the Washington Kurdish Institute (WKI), I became interested in Turkish military activity in Iraq and Northern Syria.
      We conducted an open-source research project to track airstrikes causing civilian casualties.
      I later expanded on this topic for my undergraduate thesis, analyzing where and when Turkey uses airstrikes versus proxies.

    <h2>Part One: Civilian Casualties at WKI</h2>
    <p>
      At WKI, we systematically tracked and cross-verified hundreds of airstrikes that harmed civilian populations in Northern Syria.
      Using GIS, we mapped the extent of the harm and performed statistical analysis to reveal key trends in civilian casualties.

    <h2>Part Two: Using ACLED Data to Analyze Turkish Proxies and Airstrikes</h2>
    <p>
      For my thesis, I analyzed Turkish military and proxy activity in Northern Syria and Iraq.
      Using ACLED data, I identified actors as Turkish, Turkish proxies, Kurdish targets, or actors affiliated with the Syrian/Iraqi states.
      I then determined Turkey’s methods of intervention: direct military engagement, airstrikes, or proxies.

    <p>
      To evaluate the role of terrain and population density, I mapped incidents using a raster file of population density.

    <p>
      I also ran a regression to determine if areas with lower population density were more likely to experience airstrikes, while higher-density environments saw more proxy involvement.
      Results showed Turkey’s use of airstrikes increased in low-density environments, while proxy operations dominated in densely populated areas.
