    <h3>Urban Development in Amman: A Lefebvrian Analysis of the Armenian Case</h3>
    <p>Made possible by the Babel Initiative, I worked with two collegues to conduct field research and write a paper about the effect of Urban Development on the Jordanian-Armenian population's "right to the city." The paper is currently set for publication in CAREP's 4th Edition of Bidaya, an annual journal in the humanities and social sciences. While the final publication will be in French, do not hesitate to reach out to me for an English copy of the publication. </p>
